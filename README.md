🏦 Banking Data Analysis & Customer Loyalty Prediction
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing banking data and building a customer loyalty prediction model.
It covers data processing, machine learning, and dashboard creation to provide both business insights and predictive solutions.

🔹 Objectives

• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on banking data.
• Predict customer loyalty using a classification model.
• Design interactive Power BI dashboards to analyze loans, deposits, and risk exposure.
• Integrate SQL, Python, and Power BI into a single end-to-end workflow.

🔹 Tech Stack

• Python – Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, CatBoost, Matplotlib
• SQL – Data storage, transformations, queries
• Power BI – Interactive dashboards, KPIs, and visual storytelling
• Jupyter Notebook – Data preprocessing, EDA, ML modeling

🔹 Project Workflow

1. Data Preparation
 • Loaded CSV data into SQL database
 • Cleaned and transformed dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
 • Performed EDA with visualizations

2. Machine Learning – Loyalty Classification
 • Encoded categorical features
 • Split dataset into training & test sets
 • Trained classification models (XGBoost / CatBoost)
 • Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

3. Power BI Dashboards
 • Loan Analysis: Loan growth, top occupations, nationality distribution
 • Deposit Analysis: Deposit growth, account type composition, ratios
 • Summary Page: Loan vs Deposit trends, YoY Growth %, Risk Exposure

🔹 Key Insights
• Identified top customer segments (by occupation and nationality).
• Built a loyalty prediction model with measurable accuracy.
• Designed dashboards showing loan & deposit growth trends, risk exposure, and customer distribution.
• Derived KPIs like Deposit-to-Loan Ratio and YoY Growth %.
